                                            A data inventory is a fully described record of the data assets maintained
                                            by the Clubs department. The inventory
                                            records basic information about a data asset including its name, contents,
                                            update frequency, use license, owner/maintainer,
                                            privacy considerations, data source, and other relevant details.

                                            Managing a data inventory reduces risk and uncertainty by creating a
                                            checklist for security and compliance requirements
                                            and improves a city’s ability to designate accountability for the quality of
                                            the data collected and created.
